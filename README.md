# Angular2 Demo App

This is an example app to demonstrate some of the awesome features of upcoming
Angular2 framework, such as:
 1. ES6 Modules and Classes.
 2. Shadow DOM.
 3. Annotation based program meta-data.
 4. Simple and uniform syntax for data binding through element properties and
  dom events.

The end result of the above features is a simple cognitive process of web
standards based component development.
